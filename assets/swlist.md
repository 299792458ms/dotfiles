[//]: # (footnotes)

[^1]: Unused and/or unmaintained configuration file.
[^2]: Not recommended to use multiple at a time.
[^3]: Having numerous plugins plus a custom prompt (_like starship_) will slow down your shell. If your are only interested in syntax higlight & auto suggestions I recommend either to use a light framework/plugin_manager or to drop them entirely and use fzf. Put in your ~/.zshrc: `source <(fzf --zsh)`, this will overwrite some of your zsh default bindings and allow you to search and copy commands with Control+R from your history to your prompt. As for syntax highlighting I think if you are not typing extremely long and complex commands you can live without it. Test your shell speed with ![zsh-bench](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-bench)
[^4]: You can use whatever you like, I just use this because it does not complain about .png and its auto crop/fill/resize is consistent with hyprlock. If you are not using hyprlock then I would recommend wbg or sww to set a simple wallpaper or switch wallpapers dynamically.
[^5]: The list also includes programs I use *as is* with no configuration files
[^6]: Includes icons used in waybar.
[^7]: You can use pactl or pamixer for PulseAudio. See [example](dot_config/hypr/examples/pulseaudio.conf).
[^8]: To freeze the screen while on *area select* mode use --freeze flag, this depends on *hyprpicker* so make sure to have it installed.
